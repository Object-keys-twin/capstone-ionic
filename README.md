# **Bean**

A social media hybrid app for crowd-sourced local tours ("stringbeans") that users are able to follow using Google Maps. If you want to create your own stringbean, you can search for businesses/attractions ("beans") near your location, and link them into a stringbean to share with the entire Bean community.

### 🛒 Functionality

- sign up and sign in with an email address and password.
